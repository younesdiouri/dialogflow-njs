#  DialogFlow ChatBot - Njs, socket.io & Botui


How it works ?
We use DialogFlow (ex APIAI) API in our Njs server to get JSON bot responses.
Thanks to Socket.io we can emit and receive data and display it in our chat intantly.
Finally, Botui gives us the chat interface customization, and control of the chat flow.
